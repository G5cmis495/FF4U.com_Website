                        <p>TIPS:<br>
                        * Since we do not allow drafting, we advise that you pick the maximum number of allowed players for each position.<br>
                            * When picking players for your team, we advise you to keep in mind each player’s bye week, this way all your players do not have the same bye week and you are able to have a full starting lineup each week
